Problem-------------------
Why are our best and most experienced employees
leaving prematurely? Try to predict which valuable employees
will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:
Employee satisfaction level
Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Sales
Salary
Whether the employee has left

1. Clear objects, call libraries and read file -----------------

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) ; gc()
library(dplyr)       # select statement, %>% etc
library(corrplot)    # Correlation plots
library(ggplot2)     
library(gridExtra)   # Grid of plots
```

2. Set working directory

```{r}
setwd("/home/tapas/HR_NEw/")
hr<-read.csv("hr.csv",header = T)
dim(hr)
names(hr)
str(hr)
```

3. First visualisations ------------
This graph present the correlations between each variables.
The size of the bubbles reveal the significance of the correlation,
while the colour present the direction (either positive or negative).
On average people who leave have a low satisfaction level,
they work more and didn't get promoted within the past five years.

3.1
 
```{r}
HR_correlation <- hr %>% select(satisfaction_level:promotion_last_5years)
```
3.2
 
```{r}
M <- cor(HR_correlation)
M
```

The areas of circles or squares show the absolute value
of corresponding correlation coefficients. 
Color intensity and the size of the circle are proportional
to the correlation coefficients. 

3.3

```{r}
corrplot(M)
```

 3.4

```{r}
corrplot(M, method="circle", diag = F, addCoef.col = "grey")
```

3.5

```{r}
corrplot(M, method="pie", diag = F, addCoef.col = "grey")
```

3.6

```{r}
corrplot(M, type="upper")
corrplot.mixed(M)
```

3.7

```{r}
corrplot(M, order ="AOE")
corrplot(M, order="hclust", addrect=2)
```

Who is leaving?--------------

```{r}
# 4. Filter only those who have left
hr_left <- hr %>% filter(left==1)
# 4.1 How many?
nrow(hr_left)
```

5. Let's create a data frame with only the people
that have left the company, so we can visualise
what is the distribution of each features:

```{r}
# 5.1 Divide plot window in 1 X 3 part
#     R colour names http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# 5.2
hist(hr_left$satisfaction_level,col="cadetblue4", main = "Satisfaction level") 
hist(hr_left$last_evaluation_score,col="cadetblue4", main = "Last evaluation")
hist(hr_left$average_montly_hours_worked,col="cadetblue4", main = "Average montly hours")
```

6. What about accidents and salary
Divide plot window in 1 X 2 parts

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# 6.1
hist(hr_left$Work_accident,col="lightblue", main = "Work accident")
plot(hr_left$salary,col="lightblue", main = "Salary")
```

From above plots We can see why we don't want to retain everybody.
Some people don't work well as we can see from their evaluation, 
but clearly there are also many good workers that leave.

7. Why good people leave?----------------
7.1 How many among those leaving are Good people
```{r}
nrow(hr_left)
```

 7.2

```{r}
hr_good_leaving_people <- hr_left %>% filter(last_evaluation_score >= 0.70 | time_spend_company >= 4 | number_projects > 5)
nrow(hr_good_leaving_people)
```

7.3 Percentage of good people leaving

```{r}
nrow(hr_good_leaving_people)/nrow(hr_left)
```

8. Let's analyse data of only the most valuable employees (whether left or NOT left) 
and see why they tend to leave.
8.1

```{r}
hr_allgood_people <- hr %>% filter(last_evaluation_score >= 0.70 | time_spend_company >= 4 | number_projects > 5)
```

8.2

```{r}
hr_allgood_people_select <- hr_allgood_people %>% select(satisfaction_level, number_projects: promotion_last_5years)
```

8.3

```{r}
M <- cor(hr_allgood_people_select)
```

8.4 From below plot it's much clearer. On average valuable employees 
that 'left' are not satisfayed, work on many projects, spend
many hours in the company each month and aren't promoted.

```{r}
corrplot(M, method="circle")
summary(hr_allgood_people)
```

9. From which dept people are leaving most ----------------
9.1 Order salary levels Field 'sales' is a misnomer. It actually means 'departments'

```{r}
hr$salary<-ordered(hr$salary,levels=c("low","medium","high"))
```
Management Department, has the least attrition rate as it has a
higher proportion of highly paid employees. There is almost
no attrition in High Salary Paid Employees.

9.2. How are total employees distributed department wise  

```{r}
plot_department<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=department))+geom_bar(fill="pink")+coord_flip()
plot_department
```

9.3 . How is salary-scale distributed (sort of histogram of salary)

```{r}
plot_salary<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=salary))+geom_bar(fill="lightblue")+coord_flip()
plot_salary
```

9.4. Create a department-wise bar chart and show in stacked fashion, proportion of people left
geom_bar(position="fill") makes it easier to compare proportions

```{r}
plot_department_left<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=department,fill=as.factor(left)))+geom_bar(position="fill")+coord_flip() # +scale_fill_brewer(palette="PiYG")
plot_department_left
```

9.5. How is salary distributed between those who left and did not. Did high salaried people leave?

```{r}
plot_salary_left<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=salary,fill=as.factor(left)))+geom_bar(position="fill")+coord_flip()+scale_fill_brewer(palette="PiYG")
plot_salary_left
```

9.6. Department wise, how salaried emploees are distributed. Does every dept have same ratio of low, medium and high salaried people?

```{r}
plot_salary_department<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=department,fill=salary))+geom_bar(position="fill")+scale_fill_brewer(palette="PiYG")+coord_flip()
plot_salary_department
```

9.7 Arrange all above plots in  a grid

```{r}
grid.arrange(plot_department,plot_salary,plot_department_left,plot_salary_left,plot_salary_department,ncol=2)
```

10. Median satisfaction level for the employee who left the company-----------
10.1 The median, satisfaction level for employee who left the company are
lower compared to satisfies employees.

```{r}
plot_sal_left_satisfaction<-ggplot(hr,aes(x=salary,y=satisfaction_level))+geom_boxplot()
plot_sal_left_satisfaction
```
